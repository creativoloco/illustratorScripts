# my illustrator scrips
This is a  collection of scripts using adobe extendscript API with javascript for Adobe Illustrator CC.
This collection contains all scripts that I've wrote when Illustrator had not enough tools for perform the task that I need, or when the task requieres a lot of repetitives steps.
I hope this can help you in your job as it helped to me.

## How to use:
1. Download this repo
2. Then open illustrator
3. File > script > load script
4. Select the script and execute
